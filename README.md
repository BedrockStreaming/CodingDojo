# Coding DOJO
A collection of team exercises to practice coding and share tips.

## Organization
Each exercise is stored in its own directory. It contains a readme file explaining its goal.

## Template
The `.template` folder contains a list of useful files to use when creating a new exercise, such as a makefile.
When adding a new directory, don't forget to link it below.

# Exercises
* [KataGreed](KataGreed/README.md), about naive implementation and refactoring.

# Practice
When using an exercise, create a dedicated branch with the team name and the date `burton/21-02-2022` to share the code.

# Contributing
Feel free to suggest new exercises by opening pull requests :)

An exercise should be only about one thing. Make it clear right away, written the goals first (refactoring, working TDD, etc.).
